Description: This package reads in a list of NCBI accessions with Latin names ina  list. 
    The user selects this file, and then the program downloads the sequences and annotation.
    It then creates several figures: 1. a diagram showing gene/rRNA/tRNA order on the genome
    sequences. 2. a gene order similarity matrix. 3. a sequence similarity matrix.
    It also performs k-means clustering after estimating the optimal number of k clusters.
    It also produces a Silhouette plot based on sequence similarity and also gene order.
    It also clusters the species and calculates statistics for the clusters.
